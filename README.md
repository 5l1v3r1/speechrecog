This is a set of tools for implementing speech recognition. This is the first time I have played with speech recognition, so I am not exactly sure what will be needed. Nonetheless, here is what I have so far:

 * An [MFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) package
 * A web app for recording and labeling speech samples
 * [CTC](http://goo.gl/gyisy9) recurrent neural net training
