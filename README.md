This will be a set of tools for implementing speech recognition. This is the first time I have played with speech recognition, so I am not exactly sure what will be needed. Nonetheless, here is what I have planned so far:

 * An [MFCC package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum)
 * A web app for recording and labeling speech samples
 * [CTC](ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/icml2006.pdf) recurrent neural net training
 * [Bidirectional LSTMs](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.5778.pdf)
